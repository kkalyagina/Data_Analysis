## Context

The H-1B is an employment-based, nonimmigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. Every year, the US immigration department receives over 200,000 petitions and selects 85,000 applications. The application data is available for public access and provides key insights into the prevailing wages for job titles being sponsored by US employers under H1-B visa category.

## Task

To aggregate data provided by the US government on H1-B visa applications over 3 years (2014, 2015, 2016), to tidy and wrangle this data and then to perform data analysis.

## Data Set Source

The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) generates data on visa programs including the H1-B visa. The disclosure data is updated annually and is available at: https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm
